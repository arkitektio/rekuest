"""A provider: how an app's offerings are served, declared beside its services.

A service builds a *client*; a provider builds the *agent* that provides what the
app offers. It is declared on the registry the service package ships, beside the
service, and injected the same way -- plus the clients a run has already built,
by annotation::

    @registry.service(...)
    def rekuest(rekuest: Annotated[Alias, Require("live.arkitekt.rekuest")],
                s3: Annotated[Alias, Require("live.arkitekt.s3")],
                tokens: TokenLoader, registry: AppRegistry) -> Rekuest: ...

    @registry.provider()
    def rekuest_agent(rekuest: Annotated[Alias, Require("live.arkitekt.rekuest")],
                      fakts: Fakts, registry: AppRegistry) -> RekuestAgent: ...

A run builds every client first, then the provider, then owns the agent: it binds
the run to it, applies the run's options and drives it (``aprovide``). The
provider function neither binds nor starts anything. An app is served by one
agent, so a registry holds at most one provider.
