"""Validate a definition's port calls and widgets against a catalog.

The blok side has a component walker (:mod:`rekuest.blok.walk`); a definition does not,
so this module is the one place that knows where a definition hides calls: validators and
effects on args, returns and their nested children, port-group effects, optimistic pointer
calls, and every widget, including fallback chains and the ports a SEARCH widget filters on.

It mirrors the server's ``facade.catalog_validation`` -- ``iter_definition_calls``,
``iter_definition_widgets``, ``iter_widget_calls`` and the CUSTOM-widget-as-one-node rule.
