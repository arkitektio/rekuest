    Local variables are injected by the agent, so they must not become ports on the
    definition. ``ReadOnly[SomeState]`` counts too: it is an ``Annotated`` wrapper, so
    ``is_state`` does not see through it, and without this a read-only state parameter
    was published as a required argument the caller could never supply.

    So is one annotated with a client a registered service returns (``mikro:
    Mikro``), which the agent supplies from the app it is bound to -- known only
    through ``structure_registry`` -- one annotated ``Task``, and one annotated with
    the class the app declared as its app context (handed in by ``run(context=...)``).
