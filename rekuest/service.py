"""A service: one function whose parameters are its requirements.

A client package (mikro, fluss, ...) declares one on the registry it ships, beside
the structures the client expands, and exports it
(``from mikro import mikro_service``)::

    registry = AppRegistry()

    @registry.service(schema=..., turms=...)
    def mikro(
        mikro: Annotated[Alias, Require("live.arkitekt.mikro")],
        s3:    Annotated[Alias, Require("live.arkitekt.s3")],
        tokens: TokenLoader,
    ) -> Mikro:
        ...

    @registry.structure("@mikro/arraydataset")
    async def expand_array_dataset(id: str, mikro: Mikro) -> ArrayDataset:
        return await mikro.aget_array_dataset(id)

Everything a run needs is read off the signature: the service's **name** is the
function's, **what it returns** is the client, and its **requirements** are its
:class:`~fakts.Alias` parameters -- parameter name as the key, the
:class:`~fakts.Require` marker for the rest. The return annotation is also what
ties the structures to the service: an expander (or an action) asking for a
``mikro: Mikro`` is handed the client of the service that returns a ``Mikro``.

Declaring registers nothing process-wide. An app takes a service in with
``App(services=[mikro_service])``, which merges the registry it was declared on,
and a run builds clients for exactly the services its registry holds.
