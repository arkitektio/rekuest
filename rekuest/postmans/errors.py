    A GraphQL ``assign`` creates a *root* task by definition: the backend dropped
    ``parent``/``dependency``/``method`` from ``AssignInput``, so a child task or a
    dependency method call can only be originated over the agent socket. Silently
    dropping those fields would detach a child into an orphan root, so we raise.
