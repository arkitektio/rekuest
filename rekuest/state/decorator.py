    """Declare a class as an observable state of an app.

    The implementation behind ``@app.state``. Distinct from
    :class:`~rekuest.declare.DeclaredAgentState`, which is a *dependency on another
    agent's* state -- this declares one the app owns itself.

    The class is made a dataclass if it is not one, its schema is inspected
    against the app's structures, and the app registry records it under the
    given name with its rules. The class itself is returned unchanged: it is
    the *app* that knows it as a state, so one class can be a state of any
    number of apps. An instance becomes evented when an agent adopts it (see
    :func:`~rekuest.state.observable.evented`).

    Args:
        *function: Class to decorate when used as ``@state`` without
            parentheses.
        name: Explicit exported state name. Defaults to the class name.
        required_locks: Locks that must be held while mutating this state.
        publish_interval: Debounce interval for published state updates.
        registry: The app registry the state is recorded in.
        structure_reg: Structure registry used while inspecting the state
            schema. Defaults to the app registry's.

    Returns:
        The decorated class, or a decorator configured with the provided
        metadata.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If more than one class is passed at once.

    Reached through ``AppRegistry.state``; call it directly only with
    ``registry=``.

    Examples:
        Register a state class that is observable by the runtime::

            @app.state(name="camera_state", required_locks=["camera"])
            class CameraState:
                connected: bool = False
                exposure_ms: float = 10.0
