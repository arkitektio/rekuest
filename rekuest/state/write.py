"""A task's writeable view of a state.

Many tasks write the same state instance, and every change has to say which task
made it (the patch's correlation) and which locks it holds (a state can require
some). A view carries that, explicitly: each task gets its own view, made for its
assignment, and a change made through it counts as that task's.

Like :mod:`rekuest.state.readonly`, a view is a *subclass of the state's own class
sharing its instance dict*: ``isinstance(view, MyState)`` holds and reads are live.
Assignments go through the evented ``__setattr__`` while the view's mutation is in
progress; nested lists, dicts and dataclasses are wrapped on the way out, so
``state.items.append(...)`` counts as the task's too.

Known limit, as for read-only views: a *method defined on the state class* that
mutates ``self`` writes through the underlying object, as a change made outside a
task (no correlation, no locks held).
