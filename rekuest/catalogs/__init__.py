"""Catalogs: what a UI can render and evaluate, and the rules a blok is checked against.

A *catalog* is a UI app's capability manifest. It declares the components the renderer can
draw and the pure operations it can evaluate for port validators, effects and blok util calls.

Two layers, exactly as on the server:

- The **base catalog** (``base_v1.json``, a byte-for-byte copy of the server's
  ``rekuest_core/catalogs/base_v1.json``; a test diffs them when the server tree is present)
  is implicit for every definition and blok. Its operations are always available, positional
  call arguments resolve to its parameter names, and a UI catalog only ever *extends* it.
- A **UI catalog** adds components and further operations. It may not redefine a base
  operation, and two catalogs may only agree.

This module also holds the validation rules themselves, mirroring the server's
``facade.catalog_validation``. They take plain primitives rather than the generated pydantic
models so that they stay usable from anywhere -- see the import rule below.

.. warning::
   This module must import **nothing** from ``rekuest``. ``rekuest.api.schema`` imports
   ``rekuest.traits.ports`` while it is still executing, and that reaches this loader, so any
   ``rekuest`` import here is a cycle. ``tests/test_base_catalog.py`` enforces it as a
   source-level substring check, which is why even a sibling ``rekuest.catalogs.x`` import is
   refused and everything schema-free lives in this one file. Code that needs the generated
   models lives elsewhere: ``rekuest.client.catalogs`` for the half that speaks to the server,
   ``rekuest.blok.validate`` and ``rekuest.definition.catalogs`` for the rest. This package is
   now a leaf -- it is ``__init__.py`` and ``base_v1.json``, and nothing else.
