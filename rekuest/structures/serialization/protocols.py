    """Structural type for the ports the serialization layer walks over.

    The generated GraphQL port models (``ArgPort``, ``ReturnPort`` and their
    ``ChildPort``/``Nested`` variants) form a depth-limited hierarchy, where the
    deepest leaf nodes drop ``children``/``choices``/``default``. The
    serialization routines recurse over ``children`` uniformly, so this protocol
    captures the attributes they actually read. ``children``/``choices`` are
    typed ``Any`` so the recursion type-checks regardless of the concrete
    nesting depth.

    ``nullable`` is widened to ``bool | None`` because the *Input* spelling of a
    port has a GraphQL default and is therefore optional; every reader treats it
    as a truth value.

    ``default`` is deliberately *not* a member: only arg ports carry one, so
    requiring it here made every ``ReturnPort`` fail the protocol. The one place
    that reads it (``shrink.ashrink_args``) asks for it defensively.

    Every member is a read-only property: a mutable protocol attribute is
    invariant, and the output spelling of a port (``ArgPort.nullable: bool``) and
    the input spelling (``ArgPortInput.nullable: bool | None``) could then never
    both satisfy it.
