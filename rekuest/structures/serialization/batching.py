"""One request for the ids of a structure that are expanded together.

A list port of N structures expands as N concurrent ``_expand`` calls, which used
to mean N requests. A structure that can fetch several ids at once
(``aexpand_many``) gets them in one: every id asked for in the same turn of the
event loop is collected, and fetched when that turn is over. Since expansion
already fans out with ``asyncio.gather`` at every level, this needs no special
case for lists: the elements of a list, the values of a dict, the fields of a
model and sibling arguments of the same structure all end up in one batch, and
nesting does not split it -- every leaf asks before the flush runs.

What does split it is leaves at *different* depths: the flush is scheduled when
the first id arrives, and a leaf one container deeper is still descending when it
runs. So it is one request per depth, not strictly one. Doing better means
knowing when the whole walk is quiescent, which the loop does not tell us; a
single list port, which is what this is for, is one request either way.

A structure without ``aexpand_many`` is expanded directly, exactly as before -- and
whether it has one is settled when the registry is bound, not here.
