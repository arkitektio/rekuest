"""A structure, described as data.

A description says everything needed to let a type cross a node boundary, and
does nothing: building one registers nothing, anywhere. Whoever owns a registry
turns descriptions into registrations (:meth:`StructureRegistry.declare`), which
is what lets an app's structures be exactly those of its services instead of
whatever happened to be imported into the process.

A description carries no expand or shrink function. The service that declares it
builds a client per run, and that client expands and shrinks its structures by
identifier (:class:`~rekuest.structures.client.StructureClient`).
