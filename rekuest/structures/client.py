"""What a service's client does for rekuest: expand and shrink its structures.

A structure a service declares is only data (class, identifier, widget). Turning an
id back into an object, and an object into its id, is the job of the client that
service builds for a run -- the thing that holds the connection. rekuest never
calls a per-structure function for them: it asks the bound client, by identifier.

Clients usually get it from rath's ``ExpandsStructures`` (``rath.expansion``) --
rath, because every client package depends on it while rekuest is optional for
them -- by naming their expanders::

    class Mikro(Composition, MikroApi, ExpandsStructures):
        EXPANDERS = {
            "@mikro/arraydataset": MikroApi.aget_array_dataset,
            "@mikro/file": MikroApi.aget_file,
        }
