"""Calling something, described by ids rather than by fetched models.

This is the half of the call surface that needs no GraphQL: a target is an id,
the postman is handed in, and nothing here knows what an ``Action`` or an
``Implementation`` is. The agent runtime calls through here -- dependency method
calls in particular, which never have a fetched target to begin with.

The other half, which resolves a fetched ``Action``/``Implementation`` into
those ids, is :mod:`rekuest.invoke`. Keeping them apart is what lets
``agents.hooks.startup`` and ``actors.dependency`` import a call helper without
dragging the generated client surface into the agnostic runtime.
