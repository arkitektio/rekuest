"""The FastAPI runtime serves a snapshot, as ``run(app)`` does.

When the app starts, the agent's registry is replaced by a validated, frozen
copy: the declaration is left alone, what is served cannot change under a
running server, and a declaration that does not validate fails at startup
rather than at the first assignment.
